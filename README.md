# Twitch Controls Minecraft

A mod that lets your Twitch chat lets your twitch chat make things happen in your game on specific events

Everything is customizable in-game with the base command `/tc menu`

To connect to a twitch channel use `/tc connect channel [channel-id]`

To use channel points use `/tc connect token [twitch-access-token]` this will not be sent to me. If you are using the
mod on a server, it will be stored there, if its a single player world, it will be saved on your pc.
